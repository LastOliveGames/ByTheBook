## How to set up your development environment

1. Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) 16+, [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) 11+, and [Yarn ](https://yarnpkg.com/) (either version should work, but I use 1.x).
2. Clone the repo and change to its directory.
3. Run `yarn install-all`.
3. Run `yarn dev` to spin up all the Firebase emulators and Vite, then access the app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) and the emulators at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).
